A Unity terrain rendering system for alpine enviorments. Currently it is just terrain rendering, but I want to add fast modification to the terrain.

The creation system is throttled to one update/frame, so while that is active, it is quite laggy. Once it finishes FPS should improve dramatically. You also might have to fly around a little bit. I get 60-100 FPS on a 3080.

I believe all the correct files are here for a working demo, but not everything is there (because the raw files from World Machine are massive).
