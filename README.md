# Alpine: Ski Resort Tycoon

This is a free and open source (GPL v3) ski tycoon game I am working on. It is currently in very early alpha stages, and right now is just a proof of concept of the terrain system, lift building, slope building, and basic visitor interactions.

## How to clone and set up

Use this command to clone into an empty directory `git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:charles-bruel/Alpine.git`, then open with the Unity Hub.
