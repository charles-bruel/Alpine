# Details about textures

I use textures from freepbr.com

There is no explicit license, but the author of the website says this:

> Are these PBR texture sets really free? Can I use these PBR textures for free in my games and 3d designs?
> 
> Yes. These PBR texture map sets are free to use in your games / 3d with no cost involved. It’s all free. I only ask that you don’t redistribute these PBR file sets on other sites, file sharing sites, email, and so on. Let’s keep the source files on freepbr.com only folks.

As per the author's wishes, I have .gitignore'd the png files in these folders. If you want the files, you'll have to download them yourself. The the folders are named exactly how the textures are on the site. I left the meta files so things should remain linked when you import the files yourself.
